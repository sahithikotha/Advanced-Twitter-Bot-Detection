# Advanced-Twitter-Bot-Detection
This project focuses on detecting Twitter bot accounts using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to analyze user behavior, tweet content, and engagement patterns to classify accounts as either bots or humans. The project uses two widely studied datasets: the Twitter Bot Detection Dataset and the CRESCI 2017 dataset. Both datasets contain labeled examples of genuine and bot accounts, which were used to train and evaluate multiple models.

Several models were implemented and tested, including Random Forest, LSTM, GRU, BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet, and T5. Each model was trained on processed data that included cleaned tweet text, numerical features such as follower counts and retweet counts, and engineered features that help identify bot-like behavior. The project also includes exploratory data analysis to understand trends within the datasets, such as common words, engagement levels, and correlations between features.

The results showed that transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and T5 performed extremely well on the structured CRESCI dataset, achieving high accuracy and strong classification results. Performance was lower on the real-world Twitter Bot Detection dataset due to noise, inconsistencies, and the increasingly human-like behavior of advanced bots. Traditional machine learning and RNN-based models achieved moderate accuracy but did not match the performance of transformer models on text-heavy classification tasks.

This repository includes the full pipeline for Twitter bot detection, including preprocessing scripts, feature extraction, data visualization, model training, and model evaluation. It serves as a useful reference for researchers, students, and developers who want to understand or improve bot detection systems. The code can be extended, modified, or used as a starting point for building more advanced detection methods or experimenting with additional datasets.
